PullToReveal
============

Combine a search result's UITableView with a MKMapView.

Just setup the PullToRevealViewController as a TableViewController with the known delegate methods.
Set pullToRevealDelegate to your desired delegate class. If the "Search" button is pressed your "-(void) PullToRevealDidSearchFor: (NSString) searchText" selector will be fired containing
the user's search-text.

Feel free to fork and use this controller, if you make any changes useful for others, please feel free to make a pull request.

Have a nice day!
